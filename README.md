Portfolio V2

Welcome to my first portfolio project built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS!

🚀 Deployment

The app is deployed and available at: [https://portfolio-v2-ten-lac.vercel.app/]

🚀 Project Overview

This is my very first project using Next.js (React v19) and Tailwind CSS (v4). Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of server-side rendering, file-based routing, and utility-first styling. I also practiced working with TypeScript to add type safety and improve code maintainability.
